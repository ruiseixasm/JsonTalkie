## JsonTalkie architecture
## Description
The center class is the `MessageRepeater` class, this class routes the JsonMessage between Uplinked
Talkers and Sockets and Downlinked Talkers and Sockets.
## Repeater diagram
![The Repeater](repeater.png)

The Repeater works in similar fashion as an HAM radio repeater on the top of a mountain, with a clear distinction of Uplinked and Downlinked communications, where the Uplinked nodes are considered remote nodes and the downlinked nodes are considered local nodes.
```
+-------------------------+      +-------------------------+
| Uplinked Sockets (node) |      | Uplinked Talkers (node) |
+-------------------------+      +-------------------------+
                        |          |
                    +------------------+
                    | Message Repeater |
                    +------------------+
                        |          |
+---------------------------+  +---------------------------+
| Downlinked Sockets (node) |  | Downlinked Talkers (node) |
+---------------------------+  +---------------------------+

## Message protocol
The extensive list of all Values is in the structure `TalkieCodes`.
### Message Value
These are the Message Values (commands):
- **noise** - Invalid, missing or malformed data
- **talk** - Lists existent talkers in the network
- **channel** - Channel management/configuration
- **ping** - Network presence check and latency
- **call** - Action Talker invocation
- **list** - Lists Talker actions
- **system** - System control/status messages
- **echo** - Messages Echo returns
- **error** - Error notification

### Broadcast Value
Local messages aren't send to uplinked Sockets, except if they are up bridged.
- **none** - No broadcast, the message is dropped
- **remote** - Broadcast to remote talkers
- **local** - Broadcast within local network talkers
- **self** - Broadcast to self only (loopback)

### System Value
This messages are exclusive to the system.
- **undefined** - Unspecified system request
- **board** - Board/system information request
- **mute** - Returns or sets the mute mode
- **drops** - Packet loss statistics
- **delay** - Network delay configuration
- **socket** - List Socket class names
- **manifesto** - Show the Manifesto class name

The `mute` setting is exclusive to the `call` commands in order to reduce network overhead.

### Repeater Rules
The `MessageRepeater` routes the messages accordingly to its source and message value, the source
comes from the call method `_transmitToRepeater` depending if it's a Socket or a Talker, both here called
nodes.
1. All `remote` messages from `up_linked` *and* `up_bridged` Sockets are routed to `down_linked` nodes (2 to 2);
1. All `remote` messages from `down_linked` nodes are routed to the `up_linked` *and* `up_bridged` Sockets (2 to 2);
1. All `local` messages are routed to all nodes except the `up_linked` Sockets (4 to 4);
1. All `self` messages from a Talker are routed to that same Talker (1 to 1);
1. All `none` messages are dropped and thus NOT sent to any node (0 to 0).

In total there are the following 5 types of nodes:
1. `up_linked` Sockets;
1. `up_bridged` Sockets;
1. `down_linked` Sockets;
1. `down_linked` Talkers;
1. `up_linked` Talkers.

A Socket being `up_linked` means that it can NOT handle or transmit `local` messages.

A Talker being `up_linked` means that it can NOT handle or transmit `remote` messages.

The setting of an `up_linked` Socket into an `up_bridged` one is needed for the case where the
communications are done in the same platform passible of being considered local and thus it shall process
`local` messages too.

The placement of a Talker as `up_linked` is intended to keep all its transmissions as local,
thus invisible to all remote Talkers.

## The Talker and its Manifesto
### Talker
These are the attributes of a Talker:
- **name** - The name by which a Talker is identified in the network and targeted with
- **description** - A brief description of the Talker returned in response to the `talk` command
- **channel** - A channel in order to be simultaneously target among other talkers
- **manifesto** - The Talker manifesto that sets all its Actions in detail

### Manifesto interface
In the folders [manifestos](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie/tree/main/manifestos) you can find further description and some manifesto examples for diverse type of actions and Talker methods processing, like echo and error.

A Manifesto **implementation** has the following attributes:
- **calls** - An array of Actions (name and description)

An example of a calls array:
```cpp
Action calls[3] = {
	{"on", "Turns led ON"},
	{"off", "Turns led OFF"},
	{"actions", "Returns the number of triggered Actions"}
};
```
Besides the calls, a Manifesto implementation should also have these mandatory methods:
```cpp
const char* class_name() const override { return "BlueManifesto"; }
const Action* _getActionsArray() const override { return calls; }
uint8_t _actionsCount() const override { return sizeof(calls)/sizeof(Action); }
```
## The Broadcast Socket (interface)
A Broadcast Socket **implementation** shall be able to receive and send in broadcast mode, this ability is required because the Talkers are recognizable by their names shown by the `talk` command, and thus, become able to auto configure the following direct connections (unicast). The broadcast communications are mainly intended to discover talkers or send to a channel (many) instead of talker name (single).

### Implementation
In the folders [sockets](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie/tree/main/sockets) you can find further description and many socket examples for diverse type of protocols and even libraries, like Ethernet and SPI protocols.

These are the member variables of the `BroadcastSocket`:
```cpp
	MessageRepeater* _message_repeater = nullptr;
	LinkType _link_type = LinkType::TALKIE_LT_NONE;

    // Pointer PRESERVE the polymorphism while objects don't!
    uint8_t _max_delay_ms = 5;
    bool _control_timing = false;
    uint16_t _last_local_time = 0;
    uint16_t _last_message_timestamp = 0;
    uint16_t _drops_count = 0;
```
And these are the methods which definition in the socket implementation is mandatory:
```cpp
virtual const char* class_name() const = 0;
virtual void _receive() = 0;
virtual bool _send(const JsonMessage& json_message) = 0;
```

## A bare minimum sketch with a Serial socket
This example is useful to illustrate how easy it is to include this library for a simple Serial socket.

### The .ino sketch for a Serial socket (115200)
```cpp
#include <JsonTalkie.hpp>
#include "SocketSerial.hpp"
#include "SerialManifesto.hpp"


const char talker_name[] = "serial";
const char talker_desc[] = "I'm a serial talker";
SerialManifesto serial_manifesto;
JsonTalker talker = JsonTalker(talker_name, talker_desc, &serial_manifesto);

// Singleton requires the & (to get a reference variable)
auto& serial_socket = SocketSerial::instance();

// SETTING THE REPEATER
BroadcastSocket* uplinked_sockets[] = { &serial_socket };
JsonTalker* downlinked_talkers[] = { &talker };
MessageRepeater message_repeater(
		uplinked_sockets, sizeof(uplinked_sockets)/sizeof(BroadcastSocket*),
		downlinked_talkers, sizeof(downlinked_talkers)/sizeof(JsonTalker*)
	);


void setup() {
    // Initialize pins FIRST before anything else
    pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW); // Start with LED off

    // Then start Serial
    Serial.begin(115200);
    delay(250); // Important: Give time for serial to initialize
    Serial.println("\n\n=== Arduino with SERIAL ===");

    // Final startup indication
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
    delay(500);
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);

    Serial.println("Setup completed - Ready for JSON communication!");
}


void loop() {
    message_repeater.loop();
}
```
### The included manifesto and socket
The included manifesto and socket are in the folders [manifestos](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie/tree/main/manifestos) and [sockets](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie/tree/main/sockets) respectively, depending on the socket implemented being used, you may have more methods available specific for that socket.
### Interacting with the Talker
This example uses a Serial socket, so, the interaction is always one-to-one, and here you have two options, using another Talker with a different Manifesto that sends commands to this one, or just for testing, do it in an easier way with the [JsonTalkerPy](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkiePy) command line in the computer. To do so just follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkiePy).

### Command line usage
Type the following commands to start the Serial communication (change port if needed)
```sh
python talk.py --socket SERIAL --port COM5
```
Then you can just type commands
```
>>> talk
        [talk serial]              I'm a serial talker
>>> list serial
        [call serial 0|on]         Turns led ON
        [call serial 1|off]        Turns led OFF
>>> ping serial
        [ping serial]              15
>>> call serial on
        [call serial on]           roger
>>> call serial off
        [call serial off]          roger
>>> call serial off
        [call serial off]          negative        Already Off!
>>>
        Exiting...
```
## Use Cases
Besides the simple examples shown above, there are other interesting use cases that are important to consider.
### One platform, multiple boards
The JsonTalkie allows both **remote** and **local** communication depending on the type of linking.
By local communication one doesn't necessarily mean in the same board, it is possible to have local communication among multiple boards as long as they are in the same *platform*, so, you may have a circuit where different boards communicate with each other via protocols like the SPI.
```
+-----------------------------+                                     +-----------------------------+
| Ethernet socket (up linked) |                              +------| SPI socket (**up bridged**) |
+-----------------------------+                              |      +-----------------------------+
                          |                                  |                    |
                 +------------------+                        |           +------------------+
                 | Message Repeater |                        |           | Message Repeater |
                 +------------------+                        |           +------------------+
                    |           |                            |                    |
+-----------------------+  +--------------------------+      |         +-----------------------+
| Talkers (down linked) |  | SPI Socket (down linked) |------+         | Talkers (down linked) |
+-----------------------+  +--------------------------+                +-----------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------+             +-----------------------------+
|                   ESP32 Board                       |             |        Arduino nano         |
+-----------------------------------------------------+             +-----------------------------+
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                    Local platform with two boards                               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
In the scheme above, the Arduino nano board has its SPI Socket configured as *bridged*, this means
that not only remote messages are sent trough it, buy *also*, local messages. The SPI Socket in
the ESP32 board is a down linked one, this means it behaves like a down linked Talker, sending both
remote and local messages to its Repeater. This way, the SPI link between both SPI Sockets carries
both remote and local messages, like a bridge.

The Repeater automatically sets the up linked sockets as up linked, so, in order to turn an up linked socket into a bridged one, you need to set it in the `setup` function like so:
```cpp
    spi_socket.setLinkType(LinkType::TALKIE_LT_UP_BRIDGED);  // Now accepts LOCAL messages too
```
With the command `system` it's possible to get the board and the sockets associated to each Talker.
```
>>> talk
	[talk spy]           	   I'm a Spy and I spy the talkers' pings
	[talk test]          	   I test the JsonMessage class
	[talk blue]          	   I turn led Blue on and off
	[talk green]         	   I'm a green talker
	[talk buzzer]        	   I'm a buzzer that buzzes
>>> system blue board
	[system blue board]  	   ESP32 (Rev: 100)
>>> system green board
	[system green board] 	   Arduino Uno/Nano (ATmega328P)
>>> system blue socket
	[system blue socket] 	   0	   Changed_EthernetENC
	[system blue socket] 	   1	   SPI_ESP_Arduino_Master
>>> system green socket
	[system green socket]	   0	   SPI_Arduino_Slave
>>>
```
Note that you can have more than two boards, given that the SPI protocol allows more than a single
connection.
### Unit testing
One difficulty in dealing with embedded development, is the ability of testing and debugging single methods,
this can be easily accomplished with the JsonTalkie. You can create a Manifesto that does just that.

Bellow is an example of a series of unit tests done to the class `JsonMessage` during its development.
```
>>> talk test
	[talk test]          	   I test the JsonMessage class
>>> list test
	[call test 0|all]    	   Tests all methods
	[call test 1|deserialize]	   Test deserialize (fill up)
	[call test 2|compare]	   Test if it's the same
	[call test 3|has]    	   Test if it finds the given char
	[call test 4|has_not]	   Test if DOESN't find the given char
	[call test 5|length] 	   Test it has the right length
	[call test 6|type]   	   Test the type of value
	[call test 7|identity]	   Extract the message identity
	[call test 8|value]  	   Checks if it has a value 0
	[call test 9|message]	   Gets the message number
	[call test 10|from]  	   Gets the from name string
	[call test 11|remove]	   Removes a given field
	[call test 12|set]   	   Sets a given field
	[call test 13|edge]  	   Tests edge cases
	[call test 14|copy]  	   Tests the copy constructor
	[call test 15|string]	   Checks if it has a value 0 as string
>>> call test edge
	[call test edge]     	   roger
>>> call test 0
	[call test 0]        	   roger
>>>
```
In the example above, specific edge cases are tested, the *roger* return means that the test passed, otherwise
the return value would be *negative*. It is also possible to run all tests at once, with roger meaning all
have passed. You can find the *test* Manifesto in the [manifestos folder](https://github.com/ruiseixasm/JsonTalkie/tree/main/manifestos).
### Inside calls
So far we have been doing remote calls from a computer via Python, but there are cases that would be useful
to do a call from inside the board's Talker itself. This is the case of the *spy* manifesto.
```
>>> talk spy
	[talk spy]           	   I'm a Spy and I spy the talkers' pings
>>> list spy
	[call spy 0|ping]    	   I ping every talker, also by name or channel
	[call spy 1|ping_self]	   I can even ping myself
	[call spy 2|call]    	   Able to do [<talker> <action>]
>>> call spy 0 blue
	[call spy 0]         	   roger	   1	   blue
>>> call spy 0 green
	[call spy 0]         	   roger	   4	   green
>>> ping blue
	[ping blue]          	   3
>>> ping green
	[ping green]         	   8
>>>
```
In the interaction above, we have the ping results, from inside the ESP32 board (spy Talker), 1 and 4 milliseconds respectively. From the computer those results are greater because they reflect the wi-fi latency too. Note that the latency values above include the return time, so, in reality, it takes around half those values to reach the Talker.

Nevertheless, with the help of the spy, we can see that the SPI connections represents an increase of 3 milliseconds in latency (4 - 1).
